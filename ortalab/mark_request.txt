# Ortalab Mark Request

## Which stages are complete?

Please mark stages that are complete with an [X].
Stages that are partially complete should be marked with a [?].
Stages that are not complete should be left blank (like [ ]).

> [X] Stage 1 (Basic Scoring)
> [X] Stage 2 (Modifiers)
> [X] Stage 3 (Easy Jokers)
> [X] Stage 4 (Medium Jokers)
> [X] Stage 5 (Hard Jokers)

## Design Excellence

If you have completed a "design excellence" task, please write what
the task was below (note, it MUST be on the list in the assignment or
approved by COMP6991 staff).

Please write a paragraph or two (max. 250 words) describing how your design was
influenced by this challenge, with specific reference to sections of your code.
If you completed the "Pull Request" design excellence, please just leave a link
to your PR.

Current implementation layers scoring via ScoringEngine, which keeps state isolated and 
makes joker effects easy to plug in through the JokerEffect trait. Stage 4 additions 
(e.g., Blackboard, Raised Fist) reuse the same flow by extending apply_independent, 
keeping card-scoring logic in score_played_card. I also centralised edition bonuses 
in helper functions so both card and joker editions reuse identical logic, reducing 
duplication. However, Stage 5 retrigger handling showed that pushing too much logic 
into score_played_card makes chained effects tricky.

## Design Limitations

If you made any design decisions which you now regret making; but don't to go back and change them,
let us know here. You can make up your design marks by acknowledging up to 5 things you would do
differently now.

Firstly, a few tests rely on cloning state.round.jokers frequently—wrapping 
this in a iterator would reduce repeated clones.

Secondly, ScoringEngine::score_played_card owns too much responsibility (editions, retriggers, joker hooks)
splitting into smaller functions would make stage 5 debugging easier.

I’m aware some Stage 3/5 fixtures still fail, due to lack of implementation or logic/edge case oversights.
